I'm a software engineering and coding worm. <br />
I get goosebumps whenever I see clean and well functioning code, as well as when I see a technology that solves a big problem in an easy-to-implement way. <br />
I like the unlimited challenge that software engineering has more than anything else. <br />
I write code in TypeScript/JavaScript by working mainly on building performant and testable frontend apps and components in React environment using different technologies with developing UI designs using CSS and SASS, and by working on building RESTful APIs in Node.js using Express and Nest.js, and using SQL/NoSQL queries with the help of different ORMs.

It's going to be my pleasure to connect with you because I believe that sharing experience with others is one of the best ways to make improvements. I love reading novels, watching TV shows and anime, learning languages, and listening to rock and metal, so I bet that we would have many exciting things to talk about in our free time ⚡️.
