I'm a software engineering and coding worm. <br />
I like the unlimited challenge that software engineering has more than anything else. <br />
I get goosebumps whenever I see clean and well functioning code, as well as when I see technologies that solve big problems in an easy-to-implement way. <br />

What do I do?
* I write code in TypeScript and JavaScript.
* I work mainly on building frontend apps and components using React.
* I develop advanced and complex designs using CSS and SASS.
* I build HTTP RESTful and GraphQL APIs in Node.js using Express, Nest.js, and Apollo.
* I manage SQL/NoSQL databases and optimize their queries with the help of different ORMs. <br />

What am I interested in the most?
* Building performant, testable, maintainable, compatible, and scalable React components.
* State management in React using Redux Observable and Rx.js.

It's going to be my pleasure to connect with you because I believe that sharing experience with others is one of the best ways to make improvements. I love reading novels, watching TV shows and anime, learning languages, and listening to rock and metal, so I bet that we would have many exciting things to talk about in our free time ⚡️.
