I'm a software engineer and a former electrical engineer. <br />
Sofware engineering isn't only a career path for me, it's also what my life was all about since I was at high school.

I write scalable and maintainable code with high performance, best design patterns and practices, test driven development, and best programming paradigm using JavaScript and TypeScript in React with developing designs using advanced CSS and SASS.
I have also experience in writing testable RESTful APIs with high performance in Node.js/Nest.js.

It's going to be my pleasure to connect with you because I believe that sharing experience with others is one of the best ways to make improvements. I love reading novels, watching TV shows and Anime, listening to Rock and Metal, so I bet that we would have something to talk about other than coding in our free time ⚡️.
