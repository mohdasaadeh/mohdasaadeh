I'm a software engineer and a former electrical engineer. <br />
I made a career shift into software engineering after 6 years of working in electrical engineering field because I wanted to pursue a career in the field that my life has been all about since the high scool.

I write code in TypeScript and JavaScript. <br />
I build frontend apps and components with high performance using React, as well as I develop UI designs using CSS and SASS. <br />
I build RESTful APIs in Node.js using Nest.js, and using SQL/NoSQL queries and ORMs.

It's going to be my pleasure to connect with you because I believe that sharing experience with others is one of the best ways to make improvements. I love reading novels, watching TV shows and Anime, listening to Rock and Metal, so I bet that we would have something to talk about other than coding in our free time ⚡️.
