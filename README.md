I'm a software engineer who made a career change into software engineering after 6 years of working in electrical engineering industry.

Software engineering isn't only a career path for me, it's also what my life was all about since I was at high school.
I love coding so much that I couldn't forget it even through the years of studying and working in electrical engineering field. I always found a way to add some coding touches over everything I did in electrical engineering.

I'm working hard nowadays on writing scalable and maintainable code with high performance, best design patterns and practices, test driven development, and best programming paradigm by using JavaScript and TypeScript in React and Node.js.

It's going to be my pleasure to connect with you because I believe that sharing experience with others is one of the best ways to make improvements. I love reading novels, watching TV shows and Anime, listening to Rock and Metal, so I bet that we would have something to talk about other than coding in our free time ⚡️.
