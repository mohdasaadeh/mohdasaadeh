I'm a software engineer. <br />
I write code in TypeScript and JavaScript. <br />
I work mainly on building performant and testable frontend apps and components using React, as well as on developing UI designs using CSS and SASS. <br />
I work also on building RESTful APIs in Node.js using Nest.js, and using SQL/NoSQL queries with the help of different ORMs.

It's going to be my pleasure to connect with you because I believe that sharing experience with others is one of the best ways to make improvements. I love reading novels, watching TV shows and Anime, listening to Rock and Metal, so I bet that we would have something to talk about other than coding in our free time ⚡️.
