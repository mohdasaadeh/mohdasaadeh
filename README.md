I'm an enthusiastic software engineer concentrated on full stack development. <br />
I like the unlimited challenge that software engineering has more than anything else. <br />
I get goosebumps whenever I see clean and well functioning code, as well as when I see technologies that solve big problems in an easy-to-implement way. <br />

What do I do?
* I write code in TypeScript and JavaScript.
* I build advanced and complex frontend apps and components using React and Next.js.
* I develop advanced and complex designs using CSS and SASS.
* I build HTTP RESTful and GraphQL APIs in Node.js using Express, Nest.js, and Apollo.
* I write SQL/NoSQL queries with the help of different ORMs. <br />

What am I interested in the most?
* Building performant, testable, maintainable, reliable, and reusable React components.
* Managing state in React. <br />
* Building scalable, high throughput, and low latency web services and APIs in Node.js. <br />

What am I learning nowadays?
* Building scalable and performant web services and APIs in Node.js.

It's going to be my pleasure to connect with you because I believe that sharing experience with others is one of the best ways to make improvements. I love reading novels, watching TV shows and anime, learning languages, and listening to rock and metal, so I bet that we would have many exciting things to talk about in our free time ⚡️.
